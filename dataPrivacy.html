      </p>
      <h3>
        General information on the legal basis for data processing on this website
      </h3>
      <p>
        If you have consented to data processing, we process your personal data on 
        the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR or Art. 9 para. 2 lit. a GDPR, 
        insofar as special categories of data are processed in accordance with 
        Art. 9 para. 1 GDPR. In the event of express consent to the transfer of 
        personal data to third countries, data processing is also carried out on 
        the basis of Art. 49 para. 1 lit. a GDPR. If you have consented to the 
        storage of cookies or access to information in your end device (e.g. 
        via device fingerprinting), the data processing is also carried out on 
        the basis of Art. 25 para. 1 GDPR. Consent can be revoked at any time. 
        If your data is required for the fulfillment of the contract or for 
        the implementation of pre-contractual measures, we process your data 
        on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR. Furthermore, we process 
        your data if this is necessary to fulfill a legal obligation on the 
        basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. c GDPR. Data processing may also be carried
        out on the basis of our legitimate interest in accordance with 
        Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR. Information on the relevant legal bases in 
        each individual case is provided in the following paragraphs of this 
        privacy policy.
      </p>
      <h3>Recipients of personal data</h3>
      <p>
        As part of our business activities, we work together with various external
        bodies. In some cases, it is also necessary to transfer personal data to
        these external bodies. We only pass on personal data to external bodies
        if this is necessary in the context of fulfilling a contract, if we are 
        legally obliged to do so (e.g. passing on data to tax authorities), if 
        we have a legitimate interest in the transfer in accordance with 
        Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR or if another legal basis permits the transfer
        of data. When using processors, we only pass on our customers' personal
        data on the basis of a valid contract for order processing. In the case 
        of joint processing, a contract for joint processing is concluded.
      </p>
      <h3>Withdrawal of your consent to data processing</h3>
      <p>
        Many data processing operations are only possible with your express consent.
        You can revoke any consent you have already given at any time. The legality
        of the data processing carried out until the revocation remains unaffected 
        by the revocation.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Right to object to the collection of data in special cases and to direct 
        advertising (Art. 21 GDPR)
      </h3>
      <p>
        IF THE DATA PROCESSING IS CARRIED OUT ON THE BASIS OF ART. 6 PARA. 1 LIT. E OR F GDPR, 
        YOU HAVE THE RIGHT AT ANY TIME TO WITHDRAW THE ARISING FROM THEIR PARTICULAR

        BASIS ON WHICH PROCESSING IS BASED CAN BE FOUND HERE: THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF 
        YOU FILE AN OBJECTION, WE NO LONGER PROCESS YOUR PERSONAL DATA CONCERNED, IT 
        IS UNLESS WE CAN FIND COMPELLING REASONS WORTHY OF PROTECTION FOR THE PROCESSING
        THAT AFFECTS YOUR INTERESTS, RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS PREVAIL OR THE PROCESSING SERVES 
        THE PURPOSE OF ASSERTION, EXERCISE OR DEFENCE OF LEGAL CLAIMS (OBJECTION PURSUANT
        TO ART. 21 PARA. 1 GDPR).
      </p>
      <p>
        IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS PROCESSED FOR THE PURPOSE OF DIRECT MARKETING, YOU HAVE 
        THE RIGHT TO OBJECT AT ANY TIME TO THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA CONCERNING 
        YOU FOR THE PURPOSE OF SUCH MARKETING; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING IN AS FAR
        AS IT IS CONNECTED WITH SUCH DIRECT ADVERTISING. IF YOU OBJECT, YOUR PERSONAL 
        DATA WILL SUBSEQUENTLY NO LONGER BE USED FOR THE PURPOSE OF DIRECT ADVERTISING
        (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO ART. 21 PARA. 2 GDPR).
      </p>
      <h3>
        Right of appeal to the responsible supervisory authority
      </h3>
      <p>
        In the event of violations of the GDPR, data subjects have the right to lodge 
        a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in the Member State of
        their habitual residence, place of work or place of the alleged violation. The
        right of appeal exists without prejudice to other administrative or judicial
        remedies.
      </p>
      <h3>Right to data portability</h3>
      <p>
        You have the right to have data that we process automatically on the basis of 
        your consent or in fulfillment of a contract handed over to you or to a third
        party in a commonly used, machine-readable format. If you request the direct 
        transfer of the data to another controller, this will only take place if it 
        is technically feasible.
      </p>
      <h3>Information, rectification and deletion</h3>
      <p>
        You have the right to free information about your stored personal data, its 
        origin and recipients and the purpose of the data processing and, if necessary,
        a right to correction or deletion of this data at any time within the framework
        of the applicable legal provisions. You can contact us at any time if you have
        further questions on the subject of personal data.
      </p>
      <h3>Right to restriction of processing</h3>
      <p>
        You have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal 
        data. You can contact us at any time to do this. The right to restriction of 
        processing exists in the following cases:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          If you dispute the accuracy of your personal data stored by us, we usually 
          need time to check this. For the duration of the review, you have the right
          to request that the processing of your personal data be restricted.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the processing of your personal data was/is carried out unlawfully, 
          you can request the restriction of data processing instead of deletion.
        </li>
        <li>
          If we no longer need your personal data, but you need it for the exercise, 
          defense or assertion of legal claims, you have the right to request the restriction
          of the processing of your personal data instead of deletion.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you have lodged an objection pursuant to Art. 21 (1) GDPR, a balance must 
          be struck between your interests and ours. As long as it has not yet been 
          determined whose interests prevail, you have the right to request the restriction
          of the processing of your personal data.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, this data - apart 
        from its storage - may only be processed with your consent or for the establishment,
        exercise or defense of legal claims or for the protection of the rights of another
        natural or legal person or for reasons of important public interest of the European
        Union or of a Member State.
